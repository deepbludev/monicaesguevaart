Ocean of Love,Acqua,false,"Not Available. Sold to private collection in Spain.

On this great planet lie deep, vast oceans with their cool refreshing waters, their tranquil scenery, and their hidden mysteries. People often go to the seashore to bathe in these waters or gaze upon their beauty. There is another ocean, far greater than the physical waters of this earth. It is an ocean that is far more permanent than the seas. It is an ocean that nourishes the soul. Furthermore, it is the ocean of spiritual consciousness, waiting to be tapped within each of us. It lies within, waiting to be discovered. Furthermore, it is there for everyone who seeks it. The ocean of spiritual consciousness is an ocean of love.",2020,Acrylic on canvas,60x60 cm,ocean-of-love,https://qwrjtjenhdrp3y1x.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/imported-paintings/ocean-of-love.jpg
Ascending,Acqua,false,"Not Available. Sold to private collection in Spain.

The dolphins are ascending, as an experience that gives freedom to their soul. Ascension arrives when the soul frees itself from earthly ties and realizes the true joy of life. I wanted to depict an inner rebirth and expansion of the mind, body, and spirit. In other words, the experience of a new being hidden and dwelling within each one of us. An upgrading process that can show a better understanding of ourselves.

This will be one of your masterpieces, those that will always be in the books when you will be talked about as a painter… You can tell that you are transmitting something from above because the words do not explain what it feels like to look at your work... it's like a meditative ecstasy. You live it and when you come back it seems like a dream…

Going With the Flow,Acqua,true,"What does “going with the flow mean”? The origin dates back to the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. He apparently encouraged people not to waste energy and fight against what you cannot change, but rather to accept things as they are instead of fighting against them and wishing things were different.

This turtle represents the epitome of going with the flow.",2021,Acrylic on canvas,50x100 cm,going-with-the-flow,https://qwrjtjenhdrp3y1x.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/imported-paintings/going-with-the-flow.jpg
Don't Worry be Happy,Acqua,true,"Trouble and challenges in everyone’s life are guaranteed, but by worrying it only becomes worse. Society frowns upon people who do not appear to worry about their lives’ problems and often deem such people as detached or foolish. It could not be further from the truth. When we stop worrying about the future and imagining worst case scenarios in our head, then we can enjoy the present moment like this betta fish.

Angel's Touch,Healing,false,"What would it be like to touch the energy of an angel? What would it be like to see one with the naked eye? This is what angels look like to me when I see them with my inner vision. 
This one makes me dizzy. Metamorphosis. I feel like I'm dying and it's a beautiful moment. I transform into a butterfly and the circle of life holds me. Everything is aerial and light, I feel God's hand through the ring and blurred sound of angel wings around. Orchid perfume pervade me. Flight between silk curtains...

Samadhi,Healing,true,"Sold to private collector in Spain.

Samadhi is the highest state of consciousness that a human can reach in life. It is the goal of our spiritual journey on Earth, the blissful return to our Divine origin. I find it very difficult to describe the consciousness of Samadhi, so I prefer to paint the vibration. Can you feel it?

Samadhi is a Sanskrit word for the highest state of consciousness one can achieve through meditation. Having practiced meditation for more than 20 years (and taught Mindfulness for a long time too) has allowed me to experience a lasting peace and inner silence that allows me to connect to the Source from which I get the inspiration to create my artworks.

The Wheel of Samsara,Healing,true,"This painting depicts how we become trapped in a counterproductive maelstrom of suffering and how this process can be reversed, showing how Buddhists place themselves in an ever changing universe of cause and effect. By illuminating the causes behind our situation of limitation and pain, the wheel of cyclic existence reveals how, through practicing antidotes to these causes, we can overcome the painful and limiting situations that are their effects.

Life’s Meandering,Lightscapes,false,"As the great philosopher Soren Kierkegaard used to say: “Life can only be understood by looking backward; but it must be lived looking forward”. Why is it so? Because our existence is never a straightforward path, but one full of meanderings, twists and turns.
